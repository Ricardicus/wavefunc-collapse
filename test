Once again, maybe there has been some sort


Let's say Jesus is, as in his famous "I Am", the path to God by showing us the way of love, of creation, via our slaughter of him. I'd take this Hitler complex to another level. What if the teaching of Christ could be revisited with focus on antrophology, as in WE are the mob, now that not just one jew has been scapegoated but the entire race of them. They are therefore, once again, the chosen people, to teach us about ourselves. 

The real Hitler complex, then, lies not in the anti-divide as posed, but instead in the analysis of the human, all-to-human, predicament of scapegoating ETC ETC, and our way out of it is to love our neightbour!!!!! Or is it romanticism ;)

Like, look at what happens if you forget my qsage, you once killed me; but your thirst knows no boundaries now that you kill my race. Every lost soul is a cry for help to a God that is all mighty but letting you die (for its teaching) in the time of need. They are therefore, once again, the chosen people. Hitler marks not just a cultural moment, an anthropological one I think. No one names their sons Adolf anymore. We have not really landed, it took some 200 years after Jesus death

In a very american future, what if Trump was killed and scapegoated by Obama? Would there be unity, and resemblance? No one would name their son Obama, and there would be a fake anti-Obama movement in the heads of Land-alikes.
